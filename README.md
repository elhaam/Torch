# Sample Pytorch Projects

In this repository, I have three sample projects:

* A simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
* A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that I show it has much less parameters in comparison tothe ANN.
* A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that performs sequence analysis for time series data.


## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

The libraries you need to install:
  - numpy=1.16.2
  - pandas=0.24.2
  - matplotlib=3.0.3
  - scikit-learn=0.20.3
  - plotly=3.7.0
  - pip=19.0
  - python=3.7.3
  - jupyter=1.0.0



### Installing
Install the dependencies using "conda", for example:

Say what the step will be

```
conda install numpy
```
